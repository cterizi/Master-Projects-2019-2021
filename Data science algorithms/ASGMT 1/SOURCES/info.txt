- DELIVERABLES: main folder
	/*FOLDERS*/
		+++ code: contains 3 python files
			---- main.py: 
					(1) Text representation as a set of integers
					(2) MinHash implementation and write real and predicted jaccard similarity to files
					(3) Choose best b and r parameters and plot the relevant graph
					(4) LSH implementation and write the candidates pairs of users to files
			---- calculateError.py:
					(1) Reads real Jaccard similarity and this one from signatures(2, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 signatures) for all users combinations
					(2) Graphic design for cdf of absolute error (real JS - predicted JS)
					(3) Graphic design for conversion time
					(4) Graphic design for TP, FN and FP (based on ground truth)
			---- lshCheck.py: 
					(1) Reads candidate users from "step3_lsh_predicted_pairs_for_200_signatures" folder
					(2) For step (1) users read their text and convert them into number 
					(3) Reads ground truth data
					(4) Calculate real Jaccard siilarity (JS threshold = 0.85)
					(5) Graphic design
		+++ step2_real_JS_for_200_signatures: contains 1 txt file, it has 4 columns -> user1 user2 JS(real) JS(200 signatures)
			---- 100.txt
		+++ step3_lsh_predicted_pairs_for_200_signatures: contains 4 txt files, each file has 2 columns -> user1 user2
			---- x.txt: where x = {100, 1k, 2.5k, 10k}
	/*FILES*/
		+++ info.txt: contains info on the hierarchy / structure of the attached files
		+++ readMe.pdf: it is the main report for the project(4 pages)
